// What you see here is a basic structure for a C program.

//main() signifies that this is a function. A function is what contains code inside of it

//The main function is apart of all C programs. It's the entry point to the program, this is what gets involved when you run the program. Everything inside the {} will be executed. And you know it's a function because it has the () and a funtion is a way to organize your code.

//Again the main() function is a specail function in C when you run the  program, so there sould at least be 1 main () function in all C programs. All statements must end in a ; just like java.

//lines 1,3, and 4 aren't statements. 3 is defying a function, 4 is starting the function, 1 is doing somethig different it's including some library that you wanna use in your code. Lines 4 and 5 are statements, they are the meat and potatoes of the function.

//Also, the int is just specifying to return an int value, like in java methods. Basically saying that themain function is gunna return a number, and what the return 0; usualy means that there was no error. And sometimes you'll see a void keyword instead of an int.

//Comments are ignored by the compiler.

//this is a one line comment.usually goes at the end of a line of code

/*

    this is a multi line comment. they usually go on the top/begining of the file describing the application.

*/

/*************************************************

    you can also make them stand out like this. 

    This is a very important comment.

**************************************************/

//having too many comments to hinder the readablity of the code, making it difficult to read. choose them wisely and inteligently.

//its a good idea to write comments as you build the program.

//a cooment might help out with some logic mistake.
